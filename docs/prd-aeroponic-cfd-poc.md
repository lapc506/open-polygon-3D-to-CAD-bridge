## Aeroponic CAD-to-CFD Proof of Concept

Version 0.1  
Prepared by: CAD Integration Hub  
Repository: `lapc506/open-polygon-3D-to-CAD-bridge`  
Date: 2026-09-07  

> This document follows the structure and requirements discipline of the [SRS-Template](https://github.com/jam01/SRS-Template), which is aligned with IEEE 830 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148. It is adapted for a proof of concept: requirements define **what must be demonstrated**; implementation choices remain subject to architecture and engineering decisions.

# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Document Purpose

This PRD/SRS defines the proof of concept for transforming a Blender-modeled, substrate-free aeroponic microgreenhouse into a semantic, parametric engineering model and using that model to drive hydraulic and CFD analysis of nutrient-solution mist delivery to suspended crop roots.

The document is intended for product, architecture, software, CFD, CAD, agronomy, and QA work. It establishes a verifiable vertical slice from Blender geometry through a CAD Integration Hub Common Intermediate Model (CIM), simulation inputs, CFD results, and parameter updates.

## 1.2 Product Scope

The PoC will demonstrate a workflow in which a user creates or imports a microgreenhouse/aeroponic chamber in Blender, including root zones and real-world mister components, and the bridge reconstructs those objects as semantic CIM entities. The resulting model shall expose engineering parameters such as mister location, orientation, pressure, flow, nozzle definition, droplet distribution, piping, chamber dimensions, and root-zone geometry.

The PoC shall generate a simulation-ready model for hydraulic analysis and droplet transport CFD, run a supported solver workflow, visualize or expose root-zone delivery results, and permit parameter changes followed by regeneration and re-analysis.

The PoC does **not** attempt to prove a universal pressure-to-droplet-size relationship, nor does it initially model detailed atomization/breakup inside the nozzle. Droplet distributions are treated as measured, manufacturer-provided, or explicitly calibrated injection data.

# 2. Product Overview

## 2.1 Product Perspective

The PoC is the first domain-specific vertical slice of the CAD Integration Hub. The existing repository is intended to evolve from a 3D polygon-to-CAD bridge into a broader semantic bridge capable of representing physical systems that can be converted to CAD and simulation representations.

The target workflow is:

                       |
                       +----> CIM / CAD
```

The PoC must keep the CIM independent of Blender and independent of a particular CFD solver so that later adapters can target OpenCADStudio, Autodesk Inventor, SolidWorks, Creo, OpenFOAM, Siemens Simcenter, or other compatible systems.

## 2.2 Product Functions

1. Import or recognize a Blender microgreenhouse scene.
2. Identify semantic components: chamber, root zone, misters, nozzle instances, pipes, reservoir, pump, regulator, crop volumes, and relevant boundaries.
3. Construct a versioned CIM representation.
4. Convert Blender geometry into parametric engineering entities without requiring manual remodeling of the whole scene.
5. Associate real mister/nozzle metadata with model instances.
6. Represent pressure, flow, orientation, spray distribution, droplet population, and duty cycle as explicit parameters.
7. Build a hydraulic network representation for pressure/flow analysis.
8. Build a CFD fluid domain and droplet-injection definition.
9. Run a supported CFD workflow for airflow and Lagrangian/discrete droplet transport where the selected solver supports it.
10. Calculate root-zone delivery metrics and expose them to the user.
11. Modify parameters and regenerate simulation inputs without reconstructing the model from scratch.
12. Preserve provenance between source geometry, CIM entities, simulation inputs, and results.

## 2.3 Product Constraints

- The first PoC shall focus on **substrate-free aeroponic nutrient delivery to suspended roots**.
- Greenhouse fogging for climate cooling/humidity control is explicitly outside the primary objective.
- A mister shall not be modeled as if pressure alone uniquely determines droplet size.
- Initial CFD shall use an injection/distribution model for droplets rather than detailed internal nozzle atomization.
- Manufacturer and experimental data shall remain distinguishable from solver-derived data.
- The PoC shall be runnable without modifying the core of OpenCADStudio.
- The CIM shall be solver-neutral and CAD-target-neutral.
- Geometry and physical units shall be explicit and internally consistent.
- Numerical values used for demonstration that are not measured shall be clearly marked as illustrative assumptions.

## 2.4 User Characteristics

### CAD / mechanical designer
Needs to construct and adjust the physical system visually and parametrically, with minimal CFD expertise.

### Aeroponic system designer
Needs to place misters, define root zones, inspect hydraulic distribution, and evaluate nutrient delivery.

### CFD engineer

## 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies

### Assumptions

- A representative Blender scene can be constructed with sufficiently clean object naming or metadata for semantic extraction.
- Mister manufacturer data or measured data can be supplied for the selected nozzle.
- Root geometry can initially be represented as a simplified porous/solid proxy rather than a complete botanical reconstruction.
- A CFD solver capable of the required continuous-phase and particle/droplet transport can be installed in the development environment.
- Initial validation can use synthetic/reference cases before physical experiments are available.

### Dependencies

- Blender and its Python API/add-on environment for scene-side extraction.
- Rust toolchain and workspace infrastructure.
- A selected CFD solver adapter.
- Experimental/manufacturer data for droplet distribution and hydraulic performance.

The physical validation loop should compare:

```text

      CIM inputs
          |
          v
         CFD
          |
          v
   predicted delivery

          |
          v
     calibration data

```

The experiment shall be used to calibrate the injection/distribution representation before attempting to infer or optimize real-world operating settings.

## Appendix B — P0 physical model boundary

The initial model treats atomization as an input boundary/injection condition. It does not claim to resolve the internal breakup physics of a specific mister nozzle.

The model may simulate:

- continuous-phase airflow;
- gravity;
- turbulence where supported;
- droplet trajectories;
- droplet residence time;
- evaporation where supported;
- root-zone deposition;
- wall/non-target deposition;
- spatial delivery uniformity.

The model shall not silently claim to predict:

- exact droplet size from pressure alone;
- nozzle-specific breakup physics without calibration;
- nutrient uptake by roots from CFD alone;
- plant growth or yield from droplet transport alone.

## Appendix C — Candidate objective function

A future optimization objective may be represented as:

```text
score =
    w_delivery   * root_zone_delivery
  + w_uniformity * root_zone_uniformity
  - w_evap      * evaporation_loss
  - w_wall      * non_target_deposition
  - w_energy    * hydraulic_energy_cost
```

Weights and thresholds must be explicit study parameters. They shall not be hard-coded as biological truth.

## Appendix D — Example parameter set

The following is a schema example only and is **not** a recommended operating condition:

```yaml
system:
  chamber:
    length_m: 2.0
    width_m: 1.0
    height_m: 2.0

mister:
  pressure_bar: 3.0
  flow_l_h: null
  orientation_deg: [0, -90, 0]
  duty_cycle_s: 5

root_zone:
  representation: simplified_geometry

fluid:
  type: nutrient_solution
  density_kg_m3: null
  viscosity_pa_s: null
  surface_tension_n_m: null

notes:
  - Values must be replaced by selected hardware/manufacturer/experimental data before physical interpretation.
```

## Appendix E — Explicit non-goals

- Full-featured CAD replacement for Blender.
- Full-featured CFD GUI replacement for commercial solvers.
- Universal irrigation-product database.
- Universal pressure-to-droplet-size correlation.
- Direct autonomous control of physical aeroponic hardware in P0.
- Biological claims about plant health or yield without controlled experiments.
- Detailed nozzle internal atomization simulation in P0.

## Appendix F — Definition of Done for P0

P0 is complete when a clean checkout of the repository can demonstrate, using the canonical fixture:

1. Blender scene -> semantic CIM.
2. CIM -> validated parametric aeroponic model.
3. Parametric model -> hydraulic/CFD inputs.
4. CFD -> machine-readable results.
5. Results -> root-zone delivery metrics.
6. Parameter change -> regenerated case.
7. Second simulation -> comparable result set.
8. All artifacts retain model/version/data provenance.
9. Documentation clearly distinguishes assumptions from validated physical data.

The PoC is successful if it proves the **CAD → parametric CIM → simulation → results → parameter change → simulation** loop, even if detailed nozzle atomization and biological validation remain future work.
